# Focus Study Buddy
Focus Study Buddy is a utility to improve productivity in and out of class. In class, you can quickly capture notes from posted articles, Canvas files, etc. Outside of class, you can refer to your clipped notes, set times to study and take breaks, and write summaries to retain information. These features on top of blocking unneeded websites and line by line focus ensure that the user can stay productive.
